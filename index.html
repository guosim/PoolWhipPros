			<h3>Part Replacement</h3>
			<p>When we inspect your pool equipment, we make sure that everything is working correctly. If we encounter a problem, we will install the part for free, only charging for the cost of the part. If the part is 75 dollars or more, we will request authorization from you before installing. After we have installed a new part we leave the old part by the equipment for your inspection. In the case you do not wish to keep the part that was installed, we refund it back up to 30 days after installation. </p>

			<h3>Water Level</h3>
			<p>It is important to keep the water level at the proper level.  For liability reasons, this responsibility is left for the client. When our technician notices that your water level is low, we will leave a door tag informing you that the water level is low. We ask that water be added to the pool as soon as possible. A low water level means the skimmer cannot remove debris from the surface of the pool and keeps the pool cleaner from working well. Furthermore, a low water level can make your pump run dry, potentially causing serious damage. If this occurs, often times the repairs are extremely expensive.  We suggest that the water level be kept around the halfway mark of the skimmer opening. </p>

			<h3>Pets, Toys and Gates</h3>
			<p><b>Pets</b>: We love dogs, however sometimes your dogs don't always love us. In the event that your dog may be territorial and not as friendly, we do ask for the dog to be securely tied up or in the house or garage. Our safety is very important to us and if a pet doesn't seem too friendly we will be unable to service your pool.

			<br><b>Toys</b>: Toys make a trip to the pool much more fun!  Whether its squirt guns, pool noodles or rings, everyone love pool toys!  After the fun in the sun has come to an end, we ask that the toys be removed from the pool as often as possible. These toys can keep the pool from operating properly.  Pool noodles and other floatation devices can block the skimmer opening and also tangle the pool sweep as it moves throughout the pool. Toys that sink to the bottom keep often get stuck inside the pool cleaner and can potentially breaking an expensive part on a cleaner. To keep any of this from happening, we ask that toys be removed from the pool as often as possible. Thank you.

			<br><b>Gates</b>: We understand that you might want to keep uninvited guests from entering your backyard.  However on the day of service, we do ask that the gate is left open so our technician can enter your backyard to service your pool.  If the gate is locked upon arrival, unfortunately we will not service your pool. To prevent this from happening, you can provide us with a key and/or code to a lock box. The technician will then lock the gate on departure.
