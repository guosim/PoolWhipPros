		<p><b>Repairs</b>:  There's nothing like enjoying your pool on a hot summer day. Don't get stuck indoors when our team is ready and willing to help.

		<p><b>Spa</b>: We also provide a similar service for portable spas each week. At each visit we check the water chemistry and balance the chemicals. If dirt or debris is at the bottom we will vacuum the spa at no additional charge.</p>
		<p><b>Basic Vacuum</b>: With the basic vacuum, our technician will vacuum the bottom of your pool removing any dirt or leaves that might have accumulated over time. We recommend a basic vacuum to clients who do not have a pool cleaner in their pool or if they have an event planned that requires the pool bottom to look perfect and they do not have time for the cleaner to do the job.</p>
		<p><b>Heavy Duty Clean Up</b>: There might be times where Mother Nature does quite a number on your pool by blowing in large amounts of leaves or dirt into your pool and cleaning your pool will require a much longer time for maintenance. For these instances, we have a heavy duty clean up where we scrape and remove large amounts of leaves that would regularly clog up the vacuum. We then vacuum the bottom of the pool thoroughly. If there happens to be a large amount of dirt in the pool a filter cleaning is recommended with this clean-up.</p>

		<h1>Customer Tips</h1>
		<div class="divider"></div>
			<h3>Water Level</h3>
			<p>It is important to keep the water level at the proper level.  For liability reasons, this responsibility is left for the client. When our technician notices that your water level is low, we will leave a door tag informing you that the water level is low. We ask that water be added to the pool as soon as possible. A low water level means the skimmer cannot remove debris from the surface of the pool and keeps the pool cleaner from working well. Furthermore, a low water level can make your pump run dry, potentially causing serious damage. If this occurs, often times the repairs are extremely expensive.  We suggest that the water level be kept around the halfway mark of the skimmer opening. </p>

			<h3>Pets and Toys</h3>
			<p><b>Pets</b>: We love dogs, however sometimes your dogs don't always love us. In the event that your dog may be territorial and not as friendly, we do ask for the dog to be securely tied up or in the house or garage. Our safety is very important to us and if a pet doesn't seem too friendly we will be unable to service your pool.

			<br><b>Toys</b>: Toys make a trip to the pool much more fun!  Whether its squirt guns, pool noodles or rings, everyone love pool toys!  After the fun in the sun has come to an end, we ask that the toys be removed from the pool as often as possible. These toys can keep the pool from operating properly.  Pool noodles and other floatation devices can block the skimmer opening and also tangle the pool sweep as it moves throughout the pool. Toys that sink to the bottom keep often get stuck inside the pool cleaner and can potentially breaking an expensive part on a cleaner. To keep any of this from happening, we ask that toys be removed from the pool as often as possible. Thank you.
